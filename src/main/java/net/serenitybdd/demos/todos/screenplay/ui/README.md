# UI

Use a special **Target** class to identify elements using (by default) either CSS or XPATH. The Target object associates a selector with a human-readable label that appears in the test reports to make the reports more readable.

Targets are often stored in small Page-Object like classes that are responsible for one thing, knowing how to locate the elements for a particular UI component.
